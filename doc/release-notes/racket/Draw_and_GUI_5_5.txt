Changes to the drawing toolbox:

 * The drawing portion of the old GUI toolbox is now available as a
   separate layer: `racket/draw'. This layer can be used from plain
   Racket independent of the `racket/gui' library, although
   `racket/gui' re-exports `racket/draw'.

   The `racket/draw' library is built on top of the widely used Cairo
   drawing library and Pango text-rendering library.

 * A color bitmap can have an alpha channel, instead of just a mask
   bitmap. When drawing a bitmap, alpha channels are used more
   consistently and automatically than mask bitmaps. More
   significantly, drawing into a bitmap with an alpha channel
   preserves the drawn alphas; for example, drawing a line in the
   middle of an empty bitmap produces an image with non-zero alpha
   only at the drawn line.

   Create a bitmap with an alpha channel by supplying #t as the new
   `alpha?' argument to the `bitmap%' constructor, or by loading an
   image with a type like 'unknown/alpha insteda of 'unknown or
   'unknown/mask.

   A newly created `bitmap%' has an empty content (i.e., white with
   zero alpha), insteda of unspecified content.

   Images can be read into a `bitmap%' from from input ports, instead
   of requiring a file path.

 * A `dc<%>' supports additional drawing transformations: a rotation
   (via `set-rotation') and a general transformation matrix (via
   `set-initial-matrix').

   A transformation matrix has the form `(vector xx xy yx yy x0 y0)',
   where a point (x1, y1) is transformed to a point (x2, y2) with
   x2 = xx*x1 + yx*y1 + x0 and y2 = xy*x1 + yy*y1 + y0.

   The old translation and scaling transformations apply after the
   initial matrix. The new rotation transformation applies after the
   other transformations. This layering is a little redundant, since
   all transformations could be expressed in a single matrix, but it
   is backward compatibile.

 * A `region%' can be created as independent of any `dc<%>', in which
   cases it uses the drawing context's current transformation at the
   time that it is installed as a clipping region.

 * The old 'xor mode for pens and brushes is no longer available.
