This version of lightning version 1.2 is slightly modified for
MzScheme.

For PowerPC, branches can be generated in long-jump mode, so that
patched addresses are not limited to a 2^16 or 2^26 difference from
the current program counter.

For PowerPC, arguments are extracted directly from the original
registers by getarg.
