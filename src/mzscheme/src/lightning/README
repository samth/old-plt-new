This variant of GNU Lightning version 1.2 is slightly modified for
MzScheme:

 * For PowerPC, branches can be generated in long-jump mode, so that
   patched addresses are not limited to a 2^16 or 2^26 difference from
   the current program counter.

 * For PowerPC, arguments are extracted directly from the original
   registers by getarg.

 * For PowerPC, jit_prolog() leaves room for three local variables.

 * For Darwin i386, jit_prepare() assumes that the stack is 16-byte
   aligned, and it preserves the alignment. jit_prolog() does *not*
   automatically ensure that the stack is 16-byte aligned.

Bugs fixed since 1.2:

 * PPC jit_ldxi_* checked register instead of immediate for whether it
   fits in 16 bits
