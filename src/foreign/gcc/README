This directory is here only for configuring libffi which is
distributed as part of GCC.  It contains the minimal set of files that
make it possible to configure and build libffi.

See the ../README file for more details.

(Note: libffi is maintained as part of the GCC code repository, but it
is still distributed under the LGPL.)
