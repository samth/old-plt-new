This directory is here only for configuring libffi which is
distributed as part of GCC.  It contains the minimal set of files that
make it possible to configure and build libffi.

Synced to revision 131794 of the GCC repository.

(Note: libffi is maintained as part of the GCC code repository, but it
is still distributed under the LGPL.)
