The reduction of 'recur' does not conform to a sensible reduction
semantics.  Can you figure out why?  (For the answer, see the comment
in the 'recur' section of collects/tests/stepper/through-tests.ss.)

Primitives like 'make-number/make-numeric' that are renamed
as module provides are not displayed using their renamed
names.

Inexact numbers are not printed with a leading #i.

Expansion of quasiquote uses 'the-cons' rather than 'cons'.
This is essentially an instance of the renaming difficulty.

XML boxes evaluate successfully but are printed poorly.

non-integers are printed as fractions, rather than decimal expansions.
