These are the files for the literate version of Chat Noir.  The files
not mentioned are actually in use for Chat Noir that you get via PLT
Games.

 - chat-noir-literate.ss: the actual file containing the literate
   description of the chat noir game, as well as the game itself, in
   the chunks.

 - chat-noir-doc.ss: the wrapper file that you run via scribble to get
   the rendered output.

 - literate-lang.ss: the language for running literate programs
   (contains the tangler).

 - literate-reader.ss: the reader used for chat-noir-literate.ss to
   put it into the literate-lang.ss.

Files that begin with "literate" are the files that need to move to a
scribble library, if this experiment is successful.

Problems:

 - the code is not hyperlinked in the scribble output-- this is due to
   the confusion about how the requires should work in the two modes.

 - The char-noir-doc.ss file should be built when setup-plt runs on
   this collection to build the documentation, ie, this file should
   eventually be merged together with ../scribblings/chat-noir.scrbl.

 - hyperlink bound top-level identifiers to their bindings?
