These are the files for the literate version of Chat Noir. The files
not mentioned are actually in use for Chat Noir that you get via PLT
Games.

 - chat-noir-literate.ss: the actual file containing the literate
   description of the chat noir game, as well as the game itself, in
   the chunks.

 - chat-noir-doc.ss: the wrapper file that you run via scribble to get
   the rendered output.

 - literate-lang.ss: the language for running literate programs
   (contains the tangler)

 - literate-reader.ss: the reader used for chat-noir-literate.ss to
   put it into the literate-lang.ss.

Problems:

 - the code is not hyperlinked in the scribble output-- this is due to
   the confusion about how the requires should work in the two modes.

 - The char-noir-doc.ss file contains code that should move into
   scribble proper; ideally that file should just be (something like):

   #lang scribble/doc
   @include-literate["chat-noir-literate.ss"]

   and it should be built when setup-plt runs on this collection to
   build the documentation, ie, this file should eventually be merged
   together with ../scribblings/chat-noir.scrbl.
