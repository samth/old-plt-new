_R5RS_

The "r5rs.ss" module in the "r5rs" collection implements the language
defined by the "Revised^5 Report on the Algorithmic Language Scheme".
In addition, this module provides _#%provide_ (instead of `provide'),
_#%require_ (instead of `#%require'), `#%app', `%datum', etc.  The
`letrec' of this language is defined exactly as in R5RS, and not as in
MzScheme.

The module _r5rs.ss_ module is a language module.  You can use it in
one of several ways:

* Use the "Standard (R5RS)" language in DrScheme;

* Start MzScheme using bindings from the R5RS language with

    mzscheme -M r5rs

  (but note that MzScheme bindings will still be visible);

* Write code in a module that uses the R5RS language:

    (module foo (lib "r5rs.ss" "r5rs")
      ...)

  in this case, you can `provide' bindings and `require' other modules
  by using _#%require_ and _#%provide_.
