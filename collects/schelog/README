*** JBC 2010-04-22: this package has been TAMPERED WITH in an unscrupulous and
undisciplined way by John Clements 2010-04-22 in order to see how difficult it
would be to get it to compile in PLT 4.2.5.  The answer is "not hard", but it's
certainly not portable any more, and crucially the two macros that cause
capture of the ! symbol now require uses of the macro to supply the bang, thus
making them non-capturing.

TODO:
- pull some part of the docs across from their tex format
- figure out what to do with the makefile (delete it?)
- turn more of the implicit test cases into explicit test cases
- clean up this README file
- figure out whether there are copyright issues

Schelog is for you if you are interested in any or all
of the following: Scheme, Prolog, logic, logic
programming, AI, and expert systems.

Schelog is an embedding of logic programming a la
Prolog in Scheme.  "Embedding" means you don't lose
Scheme: You can use Prolog-style and conventional
Scheme code fragments alongside each other.  Schelog
contains the full repertoire of Prolog features,
including meta-logical and second-order ("set")
predicates, leaving out only those features that could
be more easily and more efficiently done with Scheme
subexpressions.  The Schelog distribution includes
examples and comprehensive documentation.

Schelog has been tested successfully on the following
Scheme dialects:

Bigloo, Gambit, Guile, MIT Scheme, MzScheme, Petite
Chez Scheme, Pocket Scheme, SCM, and STk.

                          ...

The Schelog distribution is available at the URL:

  http://www.cs.rice.edu/CS/PLT/packages/schelog/

Unpacking (using gunzip and tar xf) the Schelog distribution
produces a directory called "schelog".  In it is a file
called INSTALL which contains detailed installation
instructions.  Read INSTALL now.
