<h3>Retiquette: Etiquette for new Racketeers</h3>

Racketeers are expected to live up to the following rules:
<ol>
  <li>read the <a href="./index.html">style guide</a> and gradually absorb
  its recommendations;

  <li>re-assign bug reports only after they can eliminate their own code
  (e.g., a collects) from the report; the best way to accomplish this goal
  is to create a new example that re-creates the problem without
  involvement of their code;

  <!-- li -->
</ol>
