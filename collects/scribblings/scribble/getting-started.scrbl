@title[#:tag "getting-started" #:style 'toc]{Getting Started}

No matter what you want to do with Scribble, it's best to start with
an introduction on producing HTML and PDF documents in
@secref["how-to-paper"]. The end of the chapter, @secref["roadmap"],
offers advice on where to go afterward depending on your goals.
