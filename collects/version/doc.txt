_version_: PLT version checking
===============================

The version collection contains several version-related pieces that
are used by PLT Scheme.  First, the "check.ss" module provides a
single function:

> (check-version)

This procedure checks the currently available version on the PLT
website (doanload.plt-scheme.org), and returns a value that indicates
your current state -- one of these:

  * `ok
    You're fine.
  * `(ok-but ,version)
    You have a fine stable version, but note that there is a newer
    alpha version available
  * `(newer ,version)
    You have an old version, please upgrade to `version'
  * `(newer ,version ,alpha)
    You have an old-but-stable version, please upgrade to `version';
    you may consider also the newer alpha version
  * `(error ,message [,additional-info])
    An error occured, the message is a string that indicates the
    error, and the third (optional) value can be shown as the system
    error that happened (it may be a string for system errors, or a
    datum for an unexpected input from the web).


The second functionality that is provided by this collection is in the
_patchlevel_ module.  This module provides a single value:

> patchlevel

which is an integer that indicates the current patch level.  This is
normally zero, but may be updated by patches to DrScheme.
Furthermore, the "tool.ss" module makes this patchlevel appear in
DrScheme (but the binary version as reported by `(version)' is not
changed).
