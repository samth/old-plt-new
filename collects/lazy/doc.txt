This collection implements _Lazy Scheme_.

It is available as a language level and as a module that can be used
to write lazy code.  Code that uses the "lazy.ss" as a module
language:

  (module foo (lib "lazy.ss" "lazy")
    ...)

is lazy code, which is implemented using standard promises: function
applications are delayed, and promises are automatically forced.  The
language provides bindings that are equivalent to most of MzScheme and
the list library.  Primitives are strict in the expected places;
struct constructors are lazy; `if', `and', `or' etc are plain (lazy)
functions.

Mixing lazy and strict code is simple: you just write the lazy code in
the lazy language, and the rest as usual.  The lazy language treats
imported functions (that were not defined in the lazy language) as
strict, and on the strict side you only need to force (possibly
recursively) through promises.

There are a few additional bindings, the important ones are special
forms that force strict behavior -- there are severals of these that
are useful in forcing different parts of a value in different ways:

> (! expr)
  evaluates `expr' strictly (the result is always forced (over and
  over until it gets a non-promise value)).

> (!! expr)
  similar to `!', but recursively forces a structure (eg, lists).

> (!!! expr)
  similar to `!!', but also wraps procedures that it finds so their
  outputs are forced (so they are usable in a astrict world).

> (!list expr)
  forces the `expr' which is expected to be a list, and forces the
  cdrs recursively to expose a proper list structure.

> (!!list expr)
  similar to `!list', but also forces (using `!') the elements of the
  list.

There are a few side-effect bindings that are provided as is.  For
example, `read' and `printf' do the obvious thing -- but note that the
language is a call-by-need, and you need to be aware when promises are
forced.  There are also bindings for `begin' (delays a computation
that forces all sub-expressions), `when', `unless', etc.  These are,
however, less reliable and might change (or be dropped) in the future.

[More documentation will be added.]
